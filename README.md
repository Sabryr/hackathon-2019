## Projects

### Improve training material for inter-service-communication on Kubernetes (Carsten Thiel and colleagues)

This project is about improving [CESSDA](https://www.cessda.eu) training
material for an internal training in December. This is mostly focussed around
microservice architecture and inter-service-communication as well as automated
testing with quality gates/linting and ultimately running on our Kubernetes
setup.  The plan is to do this based on a virtual
[CESSDA](https://www.cessda.eu) Café consisting of a cashier, coffee
machine(s), and a waiter.  The components are ready and at the December
training participants will bring their own dockerised coffee machine along and
then deploy it in a continuous integration service with tests and running in
the Café by the end.

The goal is to make this material as re-usable as possible and would welcome
collaboration on the less CESSDA-specific (i.e. our Kubernetes) parts.
